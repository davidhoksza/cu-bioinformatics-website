                            Unlike Bachelor's or Master's studies, doctoral studies which are more oriented towards on obtaining foundational knowledge and skills and are therefore more course-oriented, PhD studies are highly specialized. To earn a PhD degree you are expected to develop expertise in a specific area of the discipline, to make original contributions to your field of study through independent research, publish the results of your research, write a dissertation about the results, and defend your work. The following sections describe various aspects of the study program.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-center">Coursework</h3>
                        <p>
                            As we strongly believe that the primary focus of a PhD studies should be on research rather than coursework. Therefore, there is only one obligatory course in the programme, the <a href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?id=8568bfaf6e4d9562abd8c4769ad69a78&tid=&do=predmet&kod=NSWI201">Doctoral Bioinformatics Seminar</a>. The idea of the seminar is for students from different fields of bioinformatics and computational biology to share their insights and knowledge, mutually broadening their views and enriching their research with new insights from related areas which are not directly within  their direct field of expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, in their first one or two years of the programme, students are expected to take 1-2 courses, which should be chosen to complement their research focus. This will enable them to develop a deeper understanding of their research area and provide them with the necessary tools to conduct high-quality research. A soft skills course which we recommend the students to take is <a href="https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~marian/Presentation_skills.html">Presentation Skills for Bioinformaticians</a>.

                            In order to be allowed to defend doctoral thesis, the student needs to fulfill the following criteria. A deviation from those criteria is possible but will be considered on an ad-hoc basis. The student needs to have least 2 impacted (<a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos">WOS</a> or <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/">SJR</a>) journal publications, with at least one having the student as the first (joint first authorship is fine) or corresponding author. In the case of an exceptionally important article in a top journal such as Nature or Science, one publication is sufficient. This requirement can be replaced in exceptional cases by peer-reviewed conferences (a typical publication format in some fields such as computer science), which must be top conferences in the field (on the order of A or A* conferences according to <a href="https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal">CORE rating</a>) and quite exceptionally by several manuscripts in Bioarxiv. These results will be recognized ad-hoc.

                    <h3 class="text-center">Doctoral exam</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is expected that the exam will be taken no later than during the 5th semester since starting the doctoral studies. The aim of the examination is to evaluate the work done so far and the progress on the dissertation. The aim is therefore not to test knowledge on the basis of a curriculum of a group of courses or fixed lists of topics. There are 2 reasons for this:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Given the dynamics of the field, specific topics would need to be updated frequently.</li>
                            <li>The programme supports a relatively broad spectrum of topics ("traditional" bioinformatics, systems biology, neuroinformatics, bioimaging, ...) and it is difficult to define the knowledge that can be considered "core" or common across all the areas (the result would be a closest common ancestor that would be somewhere in the realm of graduate or even undergraduate topics).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, the exam will consist of 2 parts:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Presentation of the dissertation topic and progress made so far.</li>
                            <li>The actual "exam"/discussion, based on the presentation and on the supplied topics (see below).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>                            
                            Bioinformatics and computational biology is an interdisciplinary programme with each research topic relying on contributions from both computer science/mathematics and biology. The exam will thus cover these two areas, with a particular focus on the student's specific research interests. The supervisor will propose the specific topic, which will be presented to the subject area board.
                            As the topic may be far from the expertise of all subject area board members, two experts in relevant fields will also be proposed for the examination. These experts may be members of the subject area board or external specialists.
                        </p>
                        <p>                            
                            The exam topic proposal should include
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A general description with a delineation in relation to the dissertation topic</li>
                            <li>A list of points containing achieved results and a work plan</li>
                            <li>Relevant literature within which a minimum level of knowledge is expected (i.e., a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition)</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Dissertation thesis</h3>
                        <h4 class="text-center">Form of the thesis</h4>
                        <p>
                            The preferred form of the thesis is an article-based thesis of papers linked by an overarching research question or theme. The thesis should include an overview introduction of approximately 30-50 pages setting the publications in a broader context. The purpose of the introduction is to provide an overview of the research domain and a summary/discussion of the results and own contributions, which are then detailed in the accompanying papers.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="text-center">Thesis defense</h4>
                        <p>
                            The thesis will be reviewed by two oponnents with at least one being from abroad. The thesis defense will include thesis presentation and discussion.
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Internship</h3>
                        <p>
                            We strongly believe that pursuing an internship abroad can provide PhD students with numerous benefits, including international experience, exposure to different research methods, a professional network, cultural immersion, and enhanced career prospects. It is an excellent opportunity for students to broaden their horizons, gain new perspectives, and develop a set of skills that will be valuable in their future careers.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the above reasons, we strongly advise at least a 3-month internship at an abroad institution. If the student does not undergo an internship it needs, the reasons for such a decision need to be explained during the thesis defense.

                        We actively develop and maintain cooperation with companies that have bioinformatics or cheminoformatics research divisions. These include companies starting from small academic start-ups up to large pharmaceutical companies. There currently exist three formal channels via which we, and the students of our study programme, interact with the industry: academia-industry meet-ups, partnership programme of Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, and industrial PhD.

The industrial PhD program establishes a legal framework for collaboration between the university and a company, ensuring the protection of the company's intellectual property. This approach benefits both the student and the employer. The student has the opportunity to apply the results of their scientific work within the company's environment, conducting applied research while receiving a salary comparable to their colleagues. In return, the student introduces new perspectives to the company by bringing in the latest research findings, including their own, and applying them as Proof-of-Concept projects. Additionally, the company gains R&D capacity without needing to establish a dedicated R&D department from scratch.

                        <p>
                            Before you apply for the doctoral study programme in Bioinforamtics and computational biology, we strongly advice you to first find an advisor and agree with them on the 
                            prospective PhD project. Although it is technically possible to submit an admission application without having an agreed upon supervisor we strongly discourage from taking 
                            such path. In order to get accepted for the study programme, you need to apply for the PhD programme either at the <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/">Faculty of Mathematics and Physics</a> or
                            <a href="https://natur.cuni.cz/">Faculty of Science</a>. The choice is basically given by the affiliation of your advisor. Should your advisor not be affiliated with either
                            of the faculties, we suggest to pick Faculty of Mathematics and Physics if the prospective doctoral project is more computationally oriented and Faculty of Science in case of 
                            more application oriented project. In any case, you will be pursuing the Ph.D. under the same study board with exactly the same rules, irrespective on the faculty under which
                            you will be officially enrolled. The choice of faculty determines whether you submit your application at the Faculty of Mathematics and physics 
                            (following <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/admissions/admission-procedure-in-phd-programmes/">this set of intructions</a>) or at the Faculty of Science
                            (following <a href="https://natur.cuni.cz/uchazeci/doktorske-studium">this set of intructions</a>). After you provide all the required documents you will
                            need to pass the entrance interview (the same irrespective of the faculty you applied to). Befor the interview, you will need to prepare and attaches a written (approximately 250-500 words) 
                            proposal for a doctoral project (part of the application form). Then, the inteview will be held in English and will have two parts. 
                            In the first part, you will present yourself and your doctoral project in a short (max 10 minutes) presentation. In the second part of the examination,
                                the committee will ask three questions. One question will focus on the project itself, and the other two questions will test the orientation in the field
                                regarding the proposed your project's topic and your previous field of study. The committee will evaluate each answer with a Pass/Fail statement. You must receive a Pass for all three answers in order to be accepted for the programme.
                            Additionally you need to demonstrate English language profficiency by passing language examination. This can be waived as described in the admission procedure materials linked above.
